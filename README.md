### Strassen's Algorithm & Naive Matrix Multiplication
#### Josh Park

#### Introduction
- What is Matrix Multiplication?
    - The definition of matrix multiplication is that if C = AB for an n × m matrix A and an m × p matrix B, then C is an n × p matrix with entries.
- Example of Matrix Multiplication
- "Suppose you were given two NxN matrices, let's call them A and B, and asked to produce the resulting multiplicative matrix C. How would you do it"

#### Methodologies (Algorithms)
- Naive Approach O(N^3) "Initially, we could take a naive approach - Just..."
- Strassen's Algorithm O(N^2.8) "Then came Strassen, pushing the boundaries and optimizing just a little further."

#### What do we observe at Small Values?
- Discuss what we observe from each of the algorithms at small values.

#### What about Large Values?
- Discuss what we observe from each of the algorithms at large values.

#### Remarks
- Talk about each of the algorithms and their pain points.
- Bring up a valid use case for each of them, unless one just gets beaten out (naive?)
